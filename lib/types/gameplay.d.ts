/**
 * Pet gameplay — the optional manifest 'gameplay' block and its host engine.
 * The block layers an opt-in mini-game over any frames2d pet: decaying stat
 * bars, currencies, a weighted idle director, touch zones, a work loop, a
 * sleep loop, passive income and a shop (issue: miku-pet generalization).
 *
 * Discipline split matches manifest-v2: STRUCTURE is fail-closed (types,
 * ranges, references into stats/tracks); the host engine is pure — every
 * verb takes an explicit clock and rng so tests stay deterministic. Decay,
 * passive income and sleep restore are lazy-settled on read (the treats.ts
 * discipline): the host runs no timers for gameplay.
