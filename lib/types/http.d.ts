/**
 * Shared JSON body/response helpers for the host route families: one strict
 * bounded body reader, one lenient bounded body reader, one JSON object
 * narrow, one JSON writer, and the outbound request-init helper that keeps a
 * host fetch body decodable (withIdentityEncoding). Previously the readers
 * were copy-pasted across the
 * package route files (routes.ts, update-routes.ts, mobile-api.ts, and each
 * family's route module) with drifting contracts: body caps ranging 4 KiB to
 * 1 MiB and four distinct overflow behaviors (reject, undefined, null, throw).
 *
 * Packages receive this file as a generated copy via scripts/sync-shared.mjs;
 * edit this shared source and re-run the sync instead of editing a copy.
 * Consumer code is migrated onto it in follow-up waves; no call site changes
 * belong in the same change as its introduction.
