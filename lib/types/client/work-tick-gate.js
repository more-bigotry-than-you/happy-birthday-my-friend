 * re-rolls, re-grants treats and re-plays the success/fail track, so the
 * outcome appears to play several times per window. The gate accepts the first
 * adjudication of a window and silently suppresses the duplicates that follow.
 *
 * The window is the active pet's own `gameplay.work.tickMs`, not a constant: a
 * pet configured with a shorter cadence must actually adjudicate that often,
 * while a fixed window would downgrade it without saying so (#1494).
