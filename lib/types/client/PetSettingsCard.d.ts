/**
 * The pet settings card: pet selection plus display layout, staged over the
 * 'pet' profile entry's own configuration (a plugin's settings ARE its Cordis
 * Config since 0.1.7, so the Host serves one form per profile entry).
 * Rendered as an always-open first-level settings page; the section wrapper
 * below mounts it as the content of the top-level 'settings.section' nav
 * entry. The petId choices come from the registry endpoint ('/api/pet/pets') —
 * the same list the sprite renders from — so the card carries no per-pet
 * knowledge.
